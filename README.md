# CodeAlpha_Secure_Coding_Review

🚀 Internship Project at CodeAlpha – Secure Coding Review 🔐

During my internship at CodeAlpha, I worked on a Flask-based secure web application and created a presentation focusing on secure coding practices.

This project involved identifying and mitigating common web vulnerabilities like:
	•	🔐 SQL Injection (fixed with parameterized queries)
	•	❌ Plaintext Passwords (secured using password hashing)
	•	⚠️ Cross-Site Scripting (handled using output escaping)
	•	🛡️ CSRF Attacks (protected via Flask-WTF)

I also used tools like Bandit, Pylint, and SAST scanners to analyze code for vulnerabilities and ensure security best practices.


🔍 Key Takeaways:
✅ Think like an attacker
✅ Validate everything
✅ Automate with tools

I’m excited to apply these secure development skills in real-world projects!
